### Description

This application allows you to pass cards back and forth between users and a deck. Before starting this lab, take a good look at the different components and try to draw out the component hierarchy. You should have a good idea of what each component is doing and how it is interacting with the shared state. Once you have a good idea of the state, then refactor the application to instead use a GameContext object.
